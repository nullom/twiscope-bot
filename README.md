## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment (Oracle Cloud)

1. **Create an Oracle Cloud VM Instance**:
   - Use Ubuntu 22.04 or later
   - Enable public IP
   - Configure security list for SSH access

2. **Use cloud-init for Automated Setup**:
   ```yaml
   #cloud-config
   package_update: true
   package_upgrade: true
   
   packages:
     - python3-pip
     - supervisor
   
   write_files:
     - path: /etc/supervisor/conf.d/twiscope.conf
       content: |
         [program:twiscope]
         directory=/opt/twiscope
         command=python3 main.py
         user=ubuntu
         autostart=true
         autorestart=true
         stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/twiscope.err.log
         stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/twiscope.out.log
   
   runcmd:
     - mkdir -p /opt/twiscope
     - git clone https://github.com/yourname/twiscope.git /opt/twiscope
     - chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /opt/twiscope
     - cd /opt/twiscope
     - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     - systemctl enable supervisor
     - systemctl start supervisor
   ```

3. **Monitor the Bot**:
   - Check Supervisor status: `sudo supervisorctl status`
   - View logs: 
     - Application logs: `/opt/twiscope/logs/twiscope.log`
     - Supervisor logs: `/var/log/supervisor/twiscope.*.log`
